'''operator overloading - Depending on the type of var + will use as addition or concartenation
in pythin decalartion of variable not required,
print a+b will directly print the sum of 2 values
Print in pythin works as println in java (every print statement in pythin will print the value in the next line)
string and int cannot be concatenated'''
